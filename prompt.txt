Q1 — Moment Sarah Almost Closes the Tab:
When the system removes or obscures her sense of agency.
This is triggered by funnel pressure, irreversible steps, forced identity capture, or unclear scope.
Her mental check is: “Am I still in control?” 
If the answer is uncertain, she moves to exit.

Q2 — Moment Marcus Almost Ignores the Notification:
When the system asks for execution without previewing the impact.
This is triggered by missing diffs, missing guarantees, unclear cost/time, or unclear ownership of failure.
His mental check is: “Can I verify the consequences before committing?”
If the answer is uncertain, he dismisses or shelves the action.

Core Pattern:
Sarah quits when autonomy is threatened.
Marcus quits when correctness is uncertain.
