# Story 8.5: Context-Aware Response Adaptation

**Status:** ready-for-dev

## Story



## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** Hybrid persona is active  
**When** the workflow step is technical (e.g., architecture review)  
**Then** responses lean technical with code examples

**Given** Hybrid persona is active  
**When** the workflow step is strategic (e.g., PRD review)  
**Then** responses lean business with impact analysis

**Given** a user asks a technical question in Business mode  
**When** the question clearly requires technical answer  
**Then** the system provides technical detail with business context wrapper

**Given** multiple personas are in a collaborative session  
**When** a shared message is sent  
**Then** each user sees their persona-appropriate version  
**And** the underlying content is identical

**Given** response adaptation occurs  
**When** I check the API response  
**Then** I see: originalContent, adaptedContent, adaptationReason, targetPersona

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Analyze acceptance criteria and create detailed implementation plan
- [ ] Design data models and database schema if needed
- [ ] Implement core business logic
- [ ] Create API endpoints and/or UI components
- [ ] Write unit tests for critical paths
- [ ] Write integration tests for key scenarios
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Perform manual testing and validation
- [ ] Code review and address feedback

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Guidance

This story should be implemented following the patterns established in the codebase:
- Follow the architecture patterns defined in `architecture.md`
- Use existing service patterns and dependency injection
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Add appropriate authorization checks based on user roles
- Follow the coding standards and conventions of the project

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests should cover business logic and edge cases
- Integration tests should verify API endpoints and database interactions
- Consider performance implications for database queries
- Test error scenarios and validation rules

### Dependencies

Review the acceptance criteria for dependencies on:
- Other stories or epics that must be completed first
- External packages or services that need to be configured
- Database migrations that need to be created

## Files to Create/Modify

Files will be determined during implementation based on:
- Data models and entities needed
- API endpoints required
- Service layer components
- Database migrations
- Test files

## Aspire Development Standards

### PostgreSQL Connection Pattern

This story uses PostgreSQL configured in Story 1.2 via Aspire:
- Connection string automatically injected from Aspire AppHost
- Pattern: `builder.AddServiceDefaults();` (inherits PostgreSQL reference)
- See Story 1.2 for AppHost configuration pattern

### Project-Wide Standards

This story follows the Aspire-first development pattern:
- **Reference:** [PROJECT-WIDE-RULES.md](../../../PROJECT-WIDE-RULES.md)
- **Primary Documentation:** https://aspire.dev
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/microsoft/aspire
