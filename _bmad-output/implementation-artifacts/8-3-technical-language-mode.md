# Story 8.3: Technical Language Mode

**Status:** ready-for-dev

## Story

As a developer (Marcus), I want full technical details, so that I can make informed implementation decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** I have Technical persona set  
**When** an agent generates content  
**Then** I receive full technical details including: code snippets, API specifications, architecture diagrams

**Given** I view a workflow step  
**When** technical details are available  
**Then** I see: data schemas, integration points, performance considerations, security implications

**Given** I ask a technical question  
**When** the agent responds  
**Then** the response includes: specific technologies, version numbers, configuration examples

**Given** I'm in technical mode  
**When** business stakeholders join the workflow  
**Then** they see their persona-appropriate version  
**And** my view remains technical

**Given** I switch to Hybrid mode  
**When** the context changes  
**Then** responses adapt: technical for implementation steps, business for strategy decisions

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Analyze acceptance criteria and create detailed implementation plan
- [ ] Design data models and database schema if needed
- [ ] Implement core business logic
- [ ] Create API endpoints and/or UI components
- [ ] Write unit tests for critical paths
- [ ] Write integration tests for key scenarios
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Perform manual testing and validation
- [ ] Code review and address feedback

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Guidance

This story should be implemented following the patterns established in the codebase:
- Follow the architecture patterns defined in `architecture.md`
- Use existing service patterns and dependency injection
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Add appropriate authorization checks based on user roles
- Follow the coding standards and conventions of the project

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests should cover business logic and edge cases
- Integration tests should verify API endpoints and database interactions
- Consider performance implications for database queries
- Test error scenarios and validation rules

### Dependencies

Review the acceptance criteria for dependencies on:
- Other stories or epics that must be completed first
- External packages or services that need to be configured
- Database migrations that need to be created

## Files to Create/Modify

Files will be determined during implementation based on:
- Data models and entities needed
- API endpoints required
- Service layer components
- Database migrations
- Test files

## Aspire Development Standards

### PostgreSQL Connection Pattern

This story uses PostgreSQL configured in Story 1.2 via Aspire:
- Connection string automatically injected from Aspire AppHost
- Pattern: `builder.AddServiceDefaults();` (inherits PostgreSQL reference)
- See Story 1.2 for AppHost configuration pattern

### Project-Wide Standards

This story follows the Aspire-first development pattern:

- **Primary Documentation:** https://aspire.dev
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/microsoft/aspire
