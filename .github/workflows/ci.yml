  # ============================================================================
  # BUILD JOB: Compile the .NET solution
  # ============================================================================
  # This job checks out the code, sets up the .NET SDK, restores dependencies,
  # and builds the solution in Release configuration. All subsequent jobs depend
  # on this job succeeding.
  # ============================================================================
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Setup the .NET SDK (version 10.0.x as per project requirements)
      - name: Setup .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
        with:
          dotnet-version: '10.0.x'

      # Step 3: Restore NuGet dependencies
      - name: Restore dependencies
        run: dotnet restore
        working-directory: src

      # Step 4: Build the solution in Release configuration
      # Using --no-restore to skip restore (already done in step 3)
      - name: Build
        run: dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore
        working-directory: src

  # ============================================================================
  # TEST JOB: Run all unit tests and report results
  # ============================================================================
  # This job runs only after the build job succeeds (needs: build).
  # It runs all unit tests with TRX (Test Results XML) logging format and
  # uploads the test results as artifacts for later analysis.
  # ============================================================================
  test:
    name: Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Setup the .NET SDK
      - name: Setup .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
        with:
          dotnet-version: '10.0.x'

      # Step 3: Restore NuGet dependencies
      - name: Restore dependencies
        run: dotnet restore
        working-directory: src

      # Step 4: Run unit tests with TRX logger
      # TRX format allows GitHub to parse and display test results
      # Tests will fail the job if any tests fail (default behavior)
      # Timeout is set to 5 minutes to prevent hanging tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: timeout 300 dotnet test --configuration Release --no-restore --logger trx --results-directory TestResults
        working-directory: src
        timeout-minutes: 5

      # Step 5: Upload test results as artifacts (runs even if tests fail)
      # This allows developers to download and analyze test results from the UI
      - name: Upload test results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: test-results-${{ github.run_id }}
          path: TestResults/*.trx

  # ============================================================================
  # NOTE: Docker orchestration handled by .NET Aspire
  # ============================================================================
  # .NET Aspire manages all container orchestration via AppHost.cs:
  # - PostgreSQL container orchestrated automatically via AppHost
  # - API and Web services run within Aspire's orchestration
  # - No separate Docker build needed for local development or CI/CD
  # - Future deployment (prod) may use Aspire Container Deployment
  # See: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/deployment/overview

# WORKFLOW EXTENSION GUIDE
# ============================================================================
# To add a new job to this workflow:
#
# 1. Add a new job block:
#    ```yaml
#    new-job:
#      name: Display Name
#      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#      needs: [build]  # List dependencies (if any)
#      steps:
#        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
#        - run: echo "Your step here"
#    ```
#
# 2. Add job dependencies if needed with `needs:` keyword
#
# 3. Use conditional execution with `if:` for branch-specific jobs
#

#
# BRANCHING STRATEGY:
# - Feature branches: feature/* or fix/* → create PR to main
# - Pull requests: All CI checks (build, test) must pass before merge
# - Main branch: Only merged PRs; protected branch with required checks
# - Hotfixes: hotfix/* → create PR to main
# - Releases: Tag with semver (v1.0.0) for automated release workflows

# ============================================================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
# ============================================================================
# 
# Q: Build job fails with "dotnet not found"
# A: Ensure actions/setup-dotnet@v4 is before the dotnet commands
#
# Q: Tests fail locally but pass in CI
# A: Check that test project is referenced in the solution file (bmadServer.sln)
#    and that all test dependencies are in the csproj file
#
# Q: Docker build fails with "Dockerfile not found"
# A: Verify the Dockerfile path in the `docker build` command matches your
#    project structure. Update the path if needed.
#
# Q: PR checks not blocking merge
# A: Go to GitHub Repo Settings > Branches > Branch Protection Rules
#    Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
#    Select "build" and "test" as required checks
#
# Q: Artifacts not uploading
# A: Check that the path in `upload-artifact` matches where tests create files
#    Verify `dotnet test --logger trx` is in your test command
